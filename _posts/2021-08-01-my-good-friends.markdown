<p class="text-center">The Exodus</p>

![Markdowm Image][0]

A few months ago, I wrote an article about my decision to turn a new page for my professional 
career. Originally, I plan to continue my grind overseas — Unfortunately, I blew my shot (on one of 
the unicorn company in Australia) as I went to the interview unprepared.

<div class="breaker"></div>

The first thing I did was to share to my good friends that I eff it up — Not to get sympathy, but 
for some reason, I felt that I need their inputs to laugh it off.

> — Pina-realize nila sayo na bobo ka HAHAHA!
> 
> — Gago, ang basic nga nang hindi mo nasagot!

And there you go, they don’t disappoint. LOL!

When all jokes were set aside, they did give sound advice and were even kind enough to share some 
opportunities for me to try on. And this is when I realized that life gets easier when you surround 
yourself with the right people.

I guess it’s true that the setback is just a setup for something better. I’m going back to grind 
tomorrow — and I believe that everything can only get better from here on out.

Thanks again to my very good friends.
