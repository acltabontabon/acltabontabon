It’s been a couple of months since I became part of a diverse team. Not gonna lie it is a bit 
intimidating at first.

So I wanted to document my learning with the hopes of someone might get a thing or two insight on 
what a diverse team puts on the table.

## Stop beating around the bush

I have a Filipino bone in my body, so I know for a fact that we normally do this because we wanted 
to be safe not to pluck a nerve. Despite that, I’ve seen so many conflicts and misunderstandings in 
the past simply because people refuse to be direct.

My foreign colleagues have shown me that there’s a significant benefit on being straightforward; 
It saves people time and provides clarity on the things that needs to be focused on.

So, **speak your mind**, just try not to step on others and you’ll be fine. However, in case that you 
accidentally pick someone’s last straw — take the high road and be the first to apologize. It ain’t 
gonna cost you that much.

On the flip side, if you’ve encountered someone who’s telling some things you aren’t happy to hear 
— don’t be too sensitive and try to understand from where they are speaking.

## You can only do so much a day

**Grind. Don’t disappoint. Provide.**

Sounds familiar isn’t it? In pursuit of a hollow ideal of productivity we often hammer ourselves 
down.

One of the things that I like with our diverse team is that it promotes and practice healthy 
environment. For instance, whenever there’s a sudden “issue” at the end of working hours, overtime 
is not their first response but rather philosophizes its real urgency and decides from there.

## The only dumb question is the one you do not ask

> “There are questions that I think I should have known as an Architect — but I still ask them anyway.”

Said by my mentor. For some whatever reason this occupy a space in my head — rent-free.

*It’s my first time being part of a diverse team so I’m a bit hesitant to ask. I kinda feel that*
*I’m making my Filipino bones look bad. I know, that’s my Filipino pride trying to get off the*
*hook. LOL!*

If you’re genuinely seeking for knowledge and afraid that people might label your question as dumb, 
bite the bullet -- coz the last thing that you’d want is to remain ignorant.

Also, asking questions gives perspective to the team on the things that needs to be further 
explained and/or documented.

**You’ll never know** that your question might be the key to open a different point of view that 
could lead to potential improvement **until you ask**.

<div class="breaker"></div>

I guess that’s enough brain dump for now.

So, if you are planning to join a diverse team but quite hesitant because of cultural differences, 
preferences on IDE, different opinions on tabs over spaces, different take on dark and light themes…

Fuck all that. **Coz at the end of the day y’all share the same goal as a team, and it is a good 
way to cultivate a professional experience**.

Thanks for reading!
